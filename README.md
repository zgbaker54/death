# death

### overview

This repository contains the source code for my shinyapp located at https://zgbaker54.shinyapps.io/death/. The app uses linear regression to predict a person's age-of-death based on their sex, race, and state. The data used in this regression was downloaded from https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D76 and reflects the deaths based on issued death certificates for U.S. residents.

### presentation
To see an example of how to run the app, along with a description of the scientific background, view presentation.mp4.

### dependencies
The app relies on the following R package: shiny, ggplot2, plotly, and splitstackshape
