The following tool was developed for a class project. It employs simple linear regression to predict age of death using three categorical metrics from data available online at https://wonder.cdc.gov/controller/datarequest/D76. Please be aware that the predictions calculated by this tool rely soley on the available regressors and DO NOT NECESSARILY IMPLY CAUSATION by said regressors. Death rate realization is a complex phenomenon which cannot be characterized in full by three metrics.
